      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Folk music is the music traditionally made by the common people. It is an extremely broad term, encompassing music made throughout the world. Folk music is often contrasted with more technically and theoretically involved "art music," and with popular music that is commercially created and distributed. Folk music laid the foundations for many other musical styles, and it continues to be celebrated in the 21st century.</p>
