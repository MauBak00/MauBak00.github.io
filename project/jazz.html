      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p><img src="https://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/wp-content/uploads/jazz-language-1.jpg">Starting in the later 19th century, African Americans in the Southern United States were influenced by the music created by slaves, as well as ragtime and the blues. They merged African, American, and European musical elements to create the earliest forms of jazz. Since then, jazz has surpassed racial boundaries and been established as a major musical form. Throughout its history, jazz has evolved in response to the social and musical conditions of its time. While very different musical styles have come to be included under the genre of jazz, they all tend to be distinguished by several shared features. Key among these are the use of swing and polyrhythms, call and response patterns, blue notes, and improvization.</p><br>
      <h2>Slave Music</h2>
      <p><img src="http://musicrising.tulane.edu/uploads/original/LatrobeCongoSquarephoto1-1395110882.png">Between the 17th to the 19th centuries, 400,000 slaves were forcibly brought to the United States, mostly from West Africa. Taken from their homes and families and shoved into the terrible hardships of slavery, many slaves sought to retain <a href="">their musical traditions</a> as a means of preserving their identities and making their suffering more bearable. Common forms of slaves' musical expression included work songs, spirituals, and ring shouts.<br><br>See a modern recreation of the music created by African slaves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxPU5517u8c&t=1393s">here</a>.</p><br>
      <h2>Ragtime</h2>

At the same time, pianos were becoming more widely used. Ragtime, characterized by emphatically syncopated rhythms, developed from African Americans who were pianists for popular entertainment venues of the time. The techniques of ragtime strongly influenced those of early jazz pianists.<br><br>In 1899, pianist and composer Scott Joplin published <a href="">Maple Leaf Rag</a>, perhaps the most well-known ragtime song.</p><br>
      <h2>Blues</h2>

Songs in this genre expressed the pain and grief of the late 19th century, one known for economic depression and virulent racism. While the earliest blues musicians were singers who accompoanied themselves with a guitar, later female vocalists with brass bands enjoyed popular success. The blues was characterized by a distinctive chord progression, the use of blue notes, instrumental improvization, and vocal lines that resembled those sung by slaves.<br><br>Hear Eddie "Son" House performing "Preaching Blues" <a href="">here.</a></p><br>
