      <p>In the pages linked above, you will find descriptions of the history and development of folk, classical, jazz, and rock music, along with examples from each of these genres. By understanding these genres, we open ourselves to the possibilities of enjoying and participating in these musical traditions, which have been used by people in different nations and eras to express themselves personally and emotionally, to connect with one another, and to pursue beauty.</p><br>

      <p>This website merely offers an introduction to these genres. To fully explore these and other musical styles, one is encouraged to seek more thorough understandings of the topics that this website covers only briefly, and to branch out into new kinds of music.</p><br>

      <p>A final note: reading about musical genres in the abstract may help to broaden one's musical horizons to include types of music they may not have otherwise been exposed to. However, to profoundly and emotionally understand music, words fall short. You must listen.</p>
