<p>Sopholcles's <cite>Oedipus Rex </cite>(citing title!) contains the following long quote: <blockquote> 
No more, no more shall you look on the misery about me, <br>
The horrors of my own doing! Too long you have known <br>
The faces of those whom I should never have seen, <br>
Too long blind to those for whom I was searching! <br>
From this hour, go in darkness!</blockquote>

And <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite> ends with this quote: "For never was a story of more woe /
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo."</p>
