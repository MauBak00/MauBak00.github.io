      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Classical music broadly encompasses European art music, ranging from ancient to contemporary works. Classical music involves an extensive theoretical system, which includes a precise and flexible system of notation. In most cases, performers strive to play classical music exactly as it is notated, maintaining its original pitches, rhythms, and dynamics instead of improvizing certain elements. While classical music continues to be widely performed today, the theory and notation it developed have also influenced other styles of music. Classical music can be largely divided into five distinct periods:</p>

      <h2>Renaissance</h2>
      <p>During the European Middle Ages, music was largely developed for religious purposes. From 1400 to 1600, several factors came together, contributing to the development of a new musical style: Renaissance music, which ranged from 1400 to 1600. These factors included the revival of Greek and Roman art, the growth of a wealthy class wiling to serve as musical patrons, and the invention of the printing press, which facilitated the distribution of sheet music. Renaissance music featured multiple blended and interweaving melodic lines, smooth melodic and harmonic progressions, and mode-based harmony that began to be replaced by functional tonality.</p><br>

      <h2>Baroque</h2>
      <p>The Baroque period, from 1600 to 1750, followed. It saw increasingly elaborate instrumental ornamentation, which was frequently improvised from figured bass notation. In addition, Baroque music included the use of tonality as the basis for harmony, the creation of new styles that mixed vocals and instruments, and the dense interweaving of many melodic lines. </p><br>
